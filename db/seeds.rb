 		that wants to stay within the premise. There are trees that surround the park, so the whole point is to fly your drone within the green area. Practice your
 		taking off and landing.Tip: This area has a play ground, so fly with caution. ")

	description:"Great park to go for a jog, people watch, lay down under a palm tree or just sit and relax. Best times to fly drones are sunrise and sunset for best footage.
	It is harder to fly the drone during the day because of the amount of activity surrounding the area.If you are confident you can control your drone, then flying 
	during the day should not be a problem")

	description:"FIU is a great spot for a beginner. You can find over a dozen pilots during the weekends, especially early in the morning. Remember: don't be shy! You might learn a lot from other droners. 
	What makes this spot ideal for a beginner is the open area where you can practice your take off and lading. and that's exactly what a beginner needs. 
	Droners have been flying in this zone for many years. Remember to be respectful and avoid flying your drone around campus because you do not want to get reported or draw attention.
	Just show up with your drone and fly! The park rangers are friendly which leaves you at ease while your are flying." )
