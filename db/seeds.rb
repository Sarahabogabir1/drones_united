 		taking off and landing.Tip: This area has a play ground, so fly with caution.")

	description:"Great park to go for a jog, people watch, lay down under a palm tree or just sit and relax. 
	Best times to fly drones are sunrise and sunset for best footage.
	It is harder to fly the drone during the day because of the amount of activity surrounding the area.
	If you are confident you can control your drone, then flying 
	during the day should not be a problem.")
